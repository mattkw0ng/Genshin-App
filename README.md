# Genshin-App
A WIP web application for calculating how much damage your character will do in the videogame Genshin Impact

The game centers around optimizing equipment and character stats, and the goal of ths project is to create a user-friendly way to find the best setup to maximize damage. There are other calculators available online, but many of them are clunky to use and I wanted to create one for myself that has a database to store your equipment and character builds.

Includes:
- python flask server
- react.js front end (note: node_modules folder is not included yet due to large number of files)
